# LCD.Polar.ECG

# Background
 This software is primarily developed to collecte ECG data 
 from Polar heart rate bands using android devices such as smartphones and pad, 
 making it convenient for athletes to collect ECG data during their training sessions.
 Furthermore, the collected ECG data can be imported into Kubios HRV for training analysis.

# Contributing
 This software's SDK is based on the PolarSDK(https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk).

 The LCD.Polar.ECG is based on the secondary development of KE.Net-ECG (https://github.com/KennethEvans/KE.Net-ECG).
 We have added the function for long-term continuous ECG data acquisition and changed the export format to be compatible with Kubios HRV.
